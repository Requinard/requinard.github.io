Hi, I'm David. I like code and blogs, so here I am.

## My experience

I'm a self-taught developer from base. I started writing shitty C# programs in the spring of 2012. While this was cool, I tried pursuing a bachelors in Electrical Engineering at Hogeschool Zuyd.
 
While I spent 2 years specializing as a low-level hardware programmer and electronics engineer. Sadly, it didn't turn out to be my thing, and in the summer of 2014 I switched from Electrical Engineer to Software engineering at fontys Eindhoven.

This is where I am currently residing. A very bored second year software student with too much experience for my study.

Late 2015 I managed to land a job at a small VR startup in Eindhoven, where I have since been active as a software engineer (Webapplication) and a systems administrator for the company.

I'll have to say that the views and words on this blog are mine and mine alone. They are not that of my school or my company. They are solely mine and I hope you can appreciate that.
