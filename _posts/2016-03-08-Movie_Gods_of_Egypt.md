No. Just no.

I cannot believe I spent more then 2 hours of my life on this movie. Not only was it bad, it was awful. It was everything I ever dreamed Justin Bieber of being (until he released his latest album, which was surprisingly good).

If you couldn't have told from the trailer already, the movie is a CGI movie. Almost none of it is real. I imagine the movie pitch went something like this:

"So we can make a pretty dece-"
"How much intersting stuff is in it?"
"A lot of cool stuff, mr executive producer"
"So, a lot?"
"We completely fleshed out a universe, sir"
"Can we at least have a bit more of the CGI fights"
"Ok, how many?"
"All of them"
"All"
"Of"
"Them"

The VFX lead promply offed himself on the spot.

Anywho, I'll update this review thingy later. See ya nerds.
