Looking back at projects is always a fun endeavour. Mostly because the 20/20 hindsight can teach you so much about software engineering itself. I want to see what leason I can take from my project, Defusal Squad

You can find the project itself [here](https://github.com/Requinard/TeamTab)

## What is this 'Defusal Squad'?

Defusal Squad is the name we gave our multiplayer co-operative/competetive game. It features heavy teamwork and communication, but in teams against eachother. The game itself was inspired by Spaceteam and is mostly our own java adaptation of this.

It's built on JavaFX, featuring our own networking stack. A fun little exercise.

## Application Design

Defusal Squad's design was made with the intent of it being fully distributed. People should be able to play it only using a local network connection. This prompted a design decision we had to make.

Our clients would be multi-purposed. A single application could be a client as well as a server. It had to be able to switch modes on the fly. While this was a big implication, we only experienced minimal fallout because of this.
